            <h3>So what comes next?</h3>

            <p>
                Interning at WizWare has opened my eyes to a lot of how the software industry works, and while I faced many 
                challenges, Iâ€™d say that it has only helped to reaffirm my desire to pursue a career in this field. 
            </p>

            <p>
                While I may struggle from time to time, the problem solving involved in a job like this is still very appealing 
                to me. I also enjoy the process of building things, whether it be physical or digital, the process of taking 
                something from concept to final product is incredibly gratifying.
            </p>

            <p>
                I would however, still like to take time to focus on certain concerns that this internship has brought about 
                to me. Very often, programming jobs are remote with flexible schedules, I find that this is somewhat 
                incompatible with my work habits. Admittedly, I have a somewhat lazy personality, and without proper structure 
                and oversight to keep me working, I often become very unproductive. The solution to this problem is to find a 
                company that allows me to come into an office space, which many still do. Creating a space within my own home 
                that can be separate from my personal areas. In the end, while these concerns are present, I believe they can be
                 overcome to allow me to be successful.

                After Graduation
            </h3>

            <p>
                Once I graduate from high school, I fully intend to pursue a degree in Computer Science. Possible schools 
                include the Colorado School of Mines and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York, although I may also 
                consider spending a few years in a community college such as Red Rocks due to costs.
            </p>

            <p>
                I believe it would also be beneficial to earn some more technical certificates. The immediate ones that come to
                 mind are the CompTIA A+ certificate and an entry-level C++ certificate.

            <h3>Thank you, Mr. Cook</h3>

            <p>
                Throughout this process Mr. Cook has been an excellent mentor. He has provided a fantastic amount of guidance
                 when necessary and autonomy to allow me to learn and act for myself. Interning at WizWare has been an
                  eye-opening experience in learning about the world of IT, and it is one that will forever cherish and that 
                  I thank Mr. Cook deeply for.
