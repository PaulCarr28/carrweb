                What did I do?
            </h3>

            <p>
                My primary project at WizWare has been to build a module or plugin for an open-source community based social media platform called HumHub.
                 This required me to work with a variety of languages and systems such as PHP, HTML, CSS, SQL, and the Yii2 framework. While
                  this project is still a work in process, my time at WizWare also saw me doing a variety of other things, such as using a 
                  CNC machine to make computer designs a reality and building simple electronics by soldering.
